STOP — your tool log shows you only SEARCHED the web and never opened or read a single full page. Search result snippets (titles, URLs, one-line descriptions) are NOT sufficient evidence: they cannot confirm novelty, and they cannot give you the exact methods, numbers, or claims of prior work.

Before you finalise this hypothesis you MUST now actually fetch and read the most relevant sources in full. Use the built-in `WebFetch` tool (or, for exact quotes/numbers, the aii-web-tools `aii_fast_web_fetch.py fetch`/`grep` script). Open at least the few most relevant URLs, read their real content, and let that evidence revise your conclusions.

Then re-write your structured output file with the corrected, evidence-grounded result. Do not stop until you have fetched at least one full page.
